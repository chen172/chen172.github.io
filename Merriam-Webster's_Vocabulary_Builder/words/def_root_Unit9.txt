<p><strong>HER</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>haerere</em>, meaning "to stick." Another form of the verb produces the root <em>hes-</em>, seen in such word as <em>adhesive</em>, which means basically "sticky" or "sticking," and <em>hesitate</em>, which means more or less "stuck in one place."</p>
<p><strong>FUG</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>fugere</em>, meaning &quot;to flee or escape.&quot; Thus, a <em>refugee</em> flees from some threat or danger, while a <em>fugitive</em> is usually fleeing from the law.</p>
<p><strong>COSM</strong> comes from the Greek word for "order." Since the Greeks believed the universe was an orderly place, words in this group usually relate to the universe. So <em>cosmonaut</em> was the word for a space traveler from the former Soviet Union. (The root of our own word, <em>astronaut</em>, suggest "star traveler" instead.) Oddly enough, <em>cosmetics</em> comes from the same root, since putting things in order is similar to decorating something--such as your face.</p>
<p><strong>SCI</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>scire</em>, "to know" or "to understand." The root appears in such common words as <em>science</em>, which originally meant simply "knowledge," and <em>conscience</em>, meaning "moral knowledge." And to be <em>conscious</em> is to be in a state where you are able to know or understand.</p>
<p><strong>JUNCT</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>jungere</em>, meaning "to join." A <em>junction</em> is a place where roads or railways come together. A <em>conjunction</em> is a word that join two other words or groups of words: "this and that," "to be or not to be."</p>
<p><strong>PART</strong> from the Latin word <em>pars</em>, meaning "part," comes into English most obviously in our word <em>part</em>. An <em>apartment</em> or <em>compartment</em> is part of a large whole. The same is usually true of a <em>particle</em>.</p>
<p><strong>MIS</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>mittere</em>, "to send." A <em>missile</em> is something sent speeding through the air or water. And when your class is <em>dismissed</em> at the end of the day, you're sent home.</p>
<p><strong>PEL</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>pellere</em>, meaning "to move or drive." So a <em>propeller</em> moves a small airplane forward. And if you <em>dispel</em> someone's fear, you "drive them away."</p>
