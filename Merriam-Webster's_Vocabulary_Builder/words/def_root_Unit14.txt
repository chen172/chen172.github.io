<p><strong>CRYPTO</strong> comes from the Greek word for "hidden." To <em>encrypt</em> a message is to encode it--that is, to hide its meaning in code language. When a scientific term begins with <em>crypto-</em>, it always means that there's something hidden about it.</p>
<p><strong>AB/ABS</strong> comes to us from Latin, and means "from," "away," or "off." <em>Abuse</em> is the use of something in the wrong way. To <em>abduct</em> is to "lead away from" or kidnap. <em>Aberrant</em> behavior that "wanders away from" what is acceptable. But there are so many words that include these root that it would be <em>absurd</em> to try to list them all here.</p>
<p><strong>PED</strong> comes from the Greek word for "child." The same root also has the meaning "foot"(see PED), but in English words it usually isn't hard to tell the two apart.</p>
<p><strong>TROP</strong> comes from the Greek <em>tropos</em>, meaning "turn" or "change." The <em>troposphere</em> is the level of the atmosphere where most weather changes--or "turns in the weather"--occur. And the <em>Tropics</em> of Cancer and Capricorn are the lines of latitude where the sun is directly overhead when it reaches its northernmost and southernmost points, on about June 22 and December 22 every year--that is, the point where it seems to turn and go back the other way.</p>
<p><strong>NEO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>neos</em>, meaning "new." <em>Neo-</em> has become a part of many English words. Some are easy to understand; for example, <em>neo-Nazi</em>. Some are less so; you might not immediately guess that <em>neotropical</em> means "from the tropics of the New World," or that a <em>neophyte</em> is a "newcomer." When William Ramsay discovered four new gases, he named them al using Greek roots that at first glance might sound slightly mysterious: <em>argon</em> ("idle"), <em>krypton</em> ("hidden"), <em>xenon</em> ("strange")--and <em>neon</em> ("new").</p>
<p><strong>NOV</strong> comes from the Latin word <em>novus</em>, meaning "new." To <em>renovate</em> an old house is to "make it new again"--that is, put it back in tip-top shape. The long-running PBS show <em>Nova</em> keeps its large audience up to date on what's new in the world of science. And when British king sent Scottish settlers to a large island off Canada's Atlantic coast in the 17th century, he named it <em>Nova Scotia</em>, or "New Scotland."</p>
<p><strong>POS</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>ponere</em>, meaning "to put" or "to place." You <em>expose</em> film by "placing it out" in the light. You <em>compose</em> a song by "putting together" a series of notes. And you <em>oppose</em> locating a new person prison in your town by "putting yourself against" it.</p>
<p><strong>TEN</strong> from the Latin verb <em>tenere</em>, basically means "hold" or "hold on to." A <em>tenant</em> is the "holder" of an apartment, house, or land, but not necessarily the owner. A <em>lieutenant</em> governor may "hold the position" ("serve in lieu") of the governor when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>MONO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>monos</em>, meaning "alone" or "single." So a <em>monorail</em> is a railroad that has only one rail; a <em>monocle</em> is an old-fashioned eyeglass that a gentleman used to squeeze into his eye socket; a <em>monotonous</em> voice seems to have only one tone; and a <em>monopoly</em> puts all ownership of a type of product or service in the hands of a single company.</p>
<p><strong>UNI</strong> comes from the Latin word for "one." A <em>uniform</em> is a single design worn by everyone. A <em>united</em> group has one single opinion, or forms a single <em>unit</em>. A <em>unitard</em> is a one-piece combination leotard and tights, very good for skating, skiing, dancing--or riding a one-wheeled <em>unicycle</em>.</p>
