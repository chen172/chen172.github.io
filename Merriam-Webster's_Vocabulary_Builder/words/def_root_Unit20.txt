<p><strong>NOM</strong> comes from the Latin word for "name." A <em>nominee</em> is a person "named"--or <em>nominated</em>--to run for or serve in office. A <em>binomial</em> ("two names") is the scientific name for a species: <em>Felis catus</em> for the house cat, for example. A <em>polynomial</em>, with "many names," is an algebra expression involving several terms: 2x^2 + 9y - z^3, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>PATER/PATR</strong> comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for "father." So a <em>patron</em>, for example, is someone who assumes a fatherly role toward an institution or project or individual, giving moral and financial support.</p>
<p><strong>LEGA</strong> comes from the Latin <em>legare</em>, meaning "to appoint" or "to send as a deputy." The same root actually shows up in such words as <em>legal</em>--but how the law connects with sending deputies can get awfully complicated and probably isn't worth going into.</p>
<p><strong>GREG</strong> comes from the Latin <em>grex</em>, "herd" or "flock." Bees, starlings, cows--any creatures that like to live together in flocks or herds--are called <em>gregarious</em>, and the same word is used for people who enjoy companionship and are happiest when they're in the middle of a rowdy herd.</p>
<p><strong>FLU</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>fluere</em>, "to flow." So a <em>flume</em> is a narrow gorge with a stream flowing through it. A <em>fluent</em> speaker is one from whom words <em>flows</em> easily. <em>Influence</em> originally referred to an invisible <em>fluid</em> that was believed to flow from the stars and to affect the actions of humans. A mysterious outbreak of disease in 15th-century Italy led Italians to blame it on the stars' <em>influenza</em>--and the name stuck.</p>
<p><strong>PREHEND/PREHENS</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>prehendere</em>, "to seize." Most of the English words where it appears are closely related to the ones discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>TEMPER</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>temperare</em>, "to moderate or keep within limits" or "to mix." Most of the world's people live in the <em>temperate</em> zone--that is, the zone where the <em>temperature</em> is moderate, between the hot tropics and the icy Arctic and Antarctic Circles. It's less easy to see how we get <em>temperature</em> from this root; the word actually used to refer to the mixing of differnet basic elements in the body, and only slowly came to mean how hot or cold that body was.</p>
<p><strong>PURG</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>purgare</em>, "to clean or cleanse." Almost all the English words where it shows up are closely to those related below.</p>
Number Words
<p><strong>MILL</strong> means either "a thousand" or "a thousandth." A <em>millennium</em> is a thousand years, and a <em>million</em> is a thousand thousands. But a <em>milligram</em> is a thousandth of a gram, a <em>milliliter</em> a thousandth of a liter, and a <em>millimeter</em> a thousandth of a meter.</p>
<p><strong>HEMI/SEMI</strong> means "half." <em>Hemi-</em> comes from Greek, <em>semi-</em> from Latin. A <em>hemisphere</em> is half a sphere, and a <em>semicircle</em> is half a circle. (The French prefix <em>demi-</em>, which probably developed from Latin as well, also means "half"--as in <em>demitasse</em>, a little after-dinner coffee cup half the size of a regular cup.)</p>
