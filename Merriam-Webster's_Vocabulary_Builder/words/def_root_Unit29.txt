<p><strong>NECRO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>nekros</em>, meaning "dead body," so it's not surprising that it shows up in some unappetizing places. A <em>necrophagous</em> insect, for instance, is one that feeds on dead bodies; when homicide investigators discover a corpse, they may use the insect evidence to figure out when the person died.</p>
<p><strong>PALEO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>palaios</em>, meaning "ancient"--that is, "older than old." The prefix sometimes gets attached to very recognizable words; <em>paleobiology</em>, for instance, deals with the biology of fossil organisms, <em>palegeography</em> is the study of geography in earlier geological eras, and <em>paleoecology</em> is the study of the releationship of plants and animals to their environment in those eras.</p>
<p><strong>CIRCU/CIRCUM</strong> comes from the Latin <em>circus</em>, meaning "circle." So a <em>circus</em> is traditionally held under a round tent. A <em>circuit</em> can be a tour around an area or territory, or the complete path of an electric current. To <em>circumnavigate</em> means "to navigate around"--often around the world.</p>
<p><strong>MINI/MINU</strong> comes from Latin words meaning "small" and "least." So the <em>minimum</em> is the least, and a <em>minute</em> amount is almost nothing. And <em>mini-</em> is all too familiar as a prefix that we've been applying to all kinds of things since the 1950s: <em>minivan, miniskirt, mini-mart, minipark</em>, and the rest.</p>
<p><strong>INTER</strong> comes straight from Latin. In English it has various meanings; all of them can be expressed broadly as "between," but they're still quite distinct: "moving between" (<em>intercity</em>), "communicating between" (<em>intercom</em>), "coming between" (<em>intercept</em>), and so on. No wonder so many English words begin with <em>inter-</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SUR</strong> is actually a shortening of the Latin prefix <em>super-</em>, meaning "over, above" (see SUPER), and has the same meaning. A <em>surface</em> is the face above or on the outside of something. A <em>surplus</em> is something above and beyond what is needed. And to <em>survey</em> a landscape is to look out over it.</p>
<p><strong>CO</strong> is a Latin prefix that generally means "with, together," and we see it daily in such words as <em>costar, cofounder, co-owner</em>, and <em>coworker</em>. But many other <em>co-</em> words aren't quite so easy to understand when you first encounter them.</p>
<p><strong>SYN</strong> is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning "together" or "at the same time." So "in sync" (short for "in synchronization") means "together in time." And a <em>synonym</em> is a word that can be considered together with another word since it has the same meaning.</p>
