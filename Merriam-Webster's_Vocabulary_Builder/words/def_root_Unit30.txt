<p><strong>TOXI</strong> comes from the Greek and Latin words for "poison," something the Greeks and Romans knew a good deal about. Socrates died by taking a solution of poison hemlock, a flowering plant much like wild carrot that now also grows in the U.S. Rome's enemy Mithridates, king of Pontus, was obsessed with poisons, experimented with them on prisoners, and tried to make himself immune to them by eating tiny amounts of them daily. Nero's mother Agrippina poisoned several of her son's rivals to power--and probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.</p>
<p><strong>TEN/TENU</strong> comes from the Latin <em>tenuis</em>, meaning "thin." So to <em>extend</em> something is to stretch it, and lots of things get thin when they're stretched. The <em>ten-</em> root is even seen in <em>pretend</em>, which once meant to stretch something out above or in front; that something came to be a claim that you were something that you actually weren't.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNI/TECHNO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>techne</em>, meaning "art, craft, skill," and shows up in dozens of English words. Some, such as <em>technical, technology</em>, and <em>technique</em>, have long been familiar. Others, such as <em>techno-thriller</em>, were only conined in the current computer age, which has also seen the new cut-down terms <em>techno</em> (for <em>techno-pop</em>, the electronic dance music) and <em>tech</em> (for <em>technician</em> or <em>technology</em>).</p>
<p><strong>LONG</strong> comes from Latin <em>longus</em>, which, as you might guess, means "long." The English word <em>long</em> shows up in many compound terms such as <em>long-suffering</em> ("patiently enduring lasting offense or hardship") and <em>long-winded</em> ("boringly long in speaking or writing"), but the <em>long-</em> root also sometimes shows up less obviously. To <em>prolong</em> something is to lengthen it, for example, and a <em>chaise longue</em> (not <em>lounge!</em>) is "a long reclining chair."</p>
<p><strong>IDIO</strong> comes from the Greek <em>idios</em>, meaning "one's own" or "private." In Latin this root led to the word <em>idiota</em>, meaning "ignorant person"--that is, a person who doesn't take in knowledge from outside himself. And that led to a familiar English word that gets used too often, usually to descirble people who aren't ignorant at all.</p>
<p><strong>AER/AERO</strong> comes from the Greek word for "air." The <em>aerospace</em> industry manufactures vehicles that travel through the atmosphere and beyond into space. <em>Aerodynamic</em> designs move through the air with maximum speed. And <em>aerophobia</em> is the technical name for what we usually just call fear of flying.</p>
<p><strong>CAD</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>cadere</em>, "to fall." Thus, a <em>cascade</em> is usually a waterfall, but sometimes a flood of something else that seems to pour on top of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade of honors, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>TRIB</strong> comes from the Latin <em>tribuere</em>, meaning "to give" or "to pay." So a group that <em>distributes</em> food passes it out to those in need, and when you <em>contribute</em> to the group you give your money or energy to it.</p>
