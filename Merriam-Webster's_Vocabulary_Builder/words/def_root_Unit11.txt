<p><strong>CANT</strong> from the Latin verb <em>cantare</em>, meaning "sing," produces several words that come directly from Latin. But some others came to English by way of French, which added an <em>h</em> to the root, giving us such words as <em>chant</em> and <em>chantey</em>.</p>
<p><strong>LINGU</strong> comes from the Latin word that means both "tongue" and "language," and in English today <em>tongue</em> can still mean "language" (as in "her native tongue"). Our expression "slip of the tongue" is just a translation of the Latin phrase <em>lapsus linguae</em>. The root even shows up in a slangy-sounding word like <em>lingo</em>. And since <em>lingu-</em> changed to <em>langu-</em> in French, our word <em>language</em> is related as well.</p>
<p><strong>SPIR</strong> comes from the Latin words meaning "breath" and "breathe." When we <em>inspire</em> others--that is, give them <em>inspiration</em>--it's as though we're breathing new energy and imagination into them. When you <em>expire</em>, or die, you "breath out" your soul in your last breath. A license, membership, credit card, or free offer may also expire, at a time indicated by its <em>expiration</em> date.</p>
<p><strong>VER</strong> comes from the Latin word for "truth." A <em>verdict</em> in a trial is "the truth spoken" (see DICT). But a just verdict may depend on the <em>veracity</em>, or "truthfulness," of the witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>TURB</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>turbare</em>, "to throw into confusion or upset," and the noun <em>turba</em>, "crowd" or "confusion." So a <em>disturbance</em>, for example, confuses and upsets normal order or routine.</p>
<p><strong>VOLU/VOLV</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>volvere</em>, meaning &quot;to roll, wind, turn around, or twist around.&quot; Thus, <em>revolve</em> simply means &quot;turn in circles.&quot; And a <em>volume</em> was originally a scroll or roll of papyrus.</p>
<p><strong>FAC</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>facere</em>, meaning "to make or do." Thus, a <em>fact</em> was originally simply "something done." A <em>benefactor</em> is someone who does good. And to <em>manufacture</em> is to make, usually in a <em>factory</em>.</p>
<p><strong>LUM</strong> comes from the Latin noun <em>lumen</em>, meaning "light." Thus, our word <em>illuminate</em> means "to supply with light" or "make clear," and <em>illumination</em> is light that shines on something.</p>
