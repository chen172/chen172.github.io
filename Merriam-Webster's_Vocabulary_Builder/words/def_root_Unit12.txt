<p><strong>UMBR</strong> come from the Latin <em>umbra</em>, meaning "shadow." Thus, the familiar <em>umbrella</em>, with its ending meaning "little," casts a "little shadow" to keep off the sun or the rain.</p>
<p><strong>VEST</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>vestire</em>, "to clothe" or "to dress," and the noun <em>vestis</em>, "clothing" or "garment." <em>Vest</em> is the shortest English word we have from this root, and is the name of a rather small piece of clothing.</p>
<p><strong>THE/THEO</strong> comes from the Greek word meaning "god." <em>Theology</em>, the study of religion, is practiced by <em>theologians</em>. <em>Monothesim</em> is the worship of a single god; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are <em>monotheistic</em> religions, and all three worship the same god. <em>Polytheistic</em> religions such as those of ancient Greek and Rome, on other hand, worship many gods.</p>
<p><strong>ICON</strong> comes from the Greek <em>eikon</em>, which led to the Latin <em>icon</em>, both meaning "image." Though the <em>icon-</em> root hasn't produced many English words, the words that is does appear in tend to be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>URB</strong> comes from the Latin noun for "city." Our word <em>urban</em> describes cities and the people who live in them. With its <em>sub-</em> prefix (SEE <a href="Unit21.txt.html#SUB">SUB</a>), a <em>suburb</em> is a town "near" or "under" a larger city, and <em>suburban</em> houses are home to <em>suburbanites</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CULT</strong> comes from the Latin <em>cultus</em>, meaning "care," So <em>cultivation</em> is care of something, such as a garden, in a way that encourages its growth. And <em>culture</em> is what is produced by cultivating human knowledge, skills, beliefs, manners, science, and art over many years.</p>
<p><strong>DEM/DEMO</strong> comes from the Greek word meaning "people." "Government by the people" was invented by the ancient Greeks, so it's appropriate that they were the first to come up with a word for it: <em>demokratia</em>, or <em>democracy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>POPUL</strong> comes from the Latin word meaning "people," and in fact forms the basis of the word <em>people</em> itself. So the <em>population</em> is the people of an area, and <em>popular</em> means not only "liked by many people" but also (as in <em>popular culture</em>) "relating to the general public."</p>
