<p><strong>MANIA</strong> is Latin means "madness," and the meaning passed ove into English unchanged. Our word <em>mania</em> can mean a mental illness, or at least an excessive enthusiasm. We might call someone a <em>maniac</em> who was wild, violent, and mentally ill--or maybe just really enthusiatic about something. Too much caffeine might make you a bit <em>manic</em>. But the intense mood swings once known as <em>manic-depressive illness</em> are now usually called <em>bipolar disorder</em> instead.</p>
<p><strong>PSYCH</strong> comes from the Greek word <em>psyche</em>, meaning "breath, life, soul." <em>Psychology</em> is the science of mind and behavior, and a <em>psychologist</em> treats or studies the mental problems of individuals and groups. <em>Psychiatry</em> is a branch of medicine that deals with mental and emotional disorders, and a <em>psychiatrist</em> (like any other doctor) may prescribe drugs to treat them.</p>
<p><strong>CEPT</strong> comes from the Latin verb meaning "take, seize." <em>Capture</em>, which is what a <em>captor</em> has done to a <em>captive</em>, has the same meaning. <em>Captivate</em> once meant literally "capture," but now means only to capture mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other English words this root produces, such as those below, its meaning is harder to find.</p>
<p><strong>FIN</strong> comes from the Latin word for "end" or "boundary." <em>Final</em> describes last things, and  a <em>finale</em> or a <em>finish</em> is an ending. (And at the end of a French film, you may just see the word "Fin.") But its meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words derived from it.</p>
<p><strong>JECT</strong> comes from <em>jacere</em>, the Latin verb meaning "throw" or "hurl." To <em>reject</em> something is to throw (or push) it back; to <em>eject</em> something is to throw (or drive) it out; and to <em>inject</em> something is to throw (or squirt) it into something else.</p>
<p><strong>TRACT</strong> comes from <em>trahere</em>, the Latin verb meaning "drag or draw." Something <em>attractive</em> draws us toward it. Something <em>distracting</em> pulls your attention away. And when you <em>extract</em> something from behind the sofa, you drag it out.</p>
<p><strong>DUC/DUCT</strong> from the Latin verb <em>ducere</em>, "to lead," shows up regularly in English. <em>Duke</em> means basically "leader." The Italian dictator Mussolini was known simply as <em>Il Duce</em>, "the leader." But such words as <em>produce</em> and <em>reduce</em> also contain the root, even though their meanings show it less clearly.</p>
<p><strong>SEQU</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>sequi</em>, meaning "to follow." A <em>sequel</em> follows the original novel, film, or television show.</p>
