<p><strong>MUR</strong> meaning "wall," has produced a modest number of English words.</p>
<p><strong>POLIS/POLIT</strong> comes from the Greek word for "city." The ancient Greek city-states, such as Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, operated much like separate nations, so all their <em>politics</em> was local, like all their public <em>policy</em>--and even all their <em>police</em>!</p>
<p><strong>NUMER</strong> comes from the Latin words meaning "number" and "to count." A <em>numeral</em> is the symbol that represents a number. <em>Numerous</em> means "many," and <em>innumerable</em> means "countless." <em>Numerical</em> superiority is superiority in numbers, and your numerical standing in a class is a ranking expressed as a number.</p>
<p><strong>KILO</strong> is the French version of the Greek word <em>chilioi</em>, meaning "thousand." France is also where the metric system originated, in the years following the French Revolution. So in English, <em>kilo-</em> shows up chiefly in metric-system units. Before the computer age, the nost familiar <em>kilo-</em> words for English-speakers were probably <em>kilowatt</em>, meaning "1,000 watts," and <em>kilowatt-hour</em>, meaning the amount of energy equal to one kilowatt over the course of an hour.</p>
<p><strong>MICRO</strong> from the Greek <em>mikros</em>, meaning "small," is a popular English prefix. A <em>microscope</em> lets the eye see <em>microscopic</em> objects, and libraries store the pages of old newspapers on <em>microfilm</em> at 1/400th of their original size. And we continue to attach <em>micro-</em> to lots of familiar words; most of us could figure out the meaning of <em>microbus</em> and <em>microquake</em> without ever having heard them before. Scientists often use <em>micro-</em> to mean "millionth"; thus, a <em>microsecond</em> is a millionth of a second, and a <em>micrometer</em> is a millionth of a meter.</p>
<p><strong>MULTI</strong> comes from the Latin word <em>multus</em>, meaning "many." Thus, a <em>multicultural</em> society is one that includes people of several different countries, languages, and religions; a <em>multimedia</em> artwork uses two or more artistic media (dance, music, film, spoken text, etc.); and a <em>multitude</em> of complaints reaching your office would be a great many indeed.</p>
<p><strong>PAR</strong> from the Latin, means "equal." Our English word <em>par</em> means an amount taken as an average or a standard, and especially the standard score for each hole on a golf course--which is why the parse "par for the course" means "about as well as expected." We <em>compare</em> things to see if they\'re equal; similar things can be called <em>comparable</em>--that is, "equal with." And "on a par with" means "comparable to."</p>
<p><strong>PHOB</strong> comes from the Greek noun <em>phobos</em>, "fear," and it shows up clearly in our noun <em>phobia</em>, meaning "unusual fear of a specific thing." Phobias vary greatly in seriousess and also in frequency. Most of us have experienced <em>claustrophobia</em> at some time, but few truly suffer from fear of the number 13, a condition known as <em>triskaidekaphobia</em>.</p>
Medical Words
<p><strong>HEM/HEMO</strong> comes from the Greek word for "blood" and is found at the beginning of many medical terms. By dropping the <em>h-</em>, the same word produced the suffix <em>-emia</em>, which likewise shows up in lots of "blood" words, including <em>anemia</em>, <em>leukemia</em> and <em>hyperglycemia</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ITIS</strong> a suffix found in both Greek and Latin, means "disease" or "inflammation." In <em>appendicitis</em> your appendix is swollen and painful, and in <em>tonsillitis</em> the same is true of your tonsils. With <em>laryngitis</em>, your throat and larynx may become so sore that it\'s difficult to talk. Some of us enjoy making up our own <em>-itis</em> words; high-school teachers, for example, long ago noticed that many of their seniors tended  to lose all interest in schoolwork and start skipping classes, and labeled the condition <em>senioritis</em>.</p>
