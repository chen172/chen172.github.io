<p><strong>ANIM</strong> comes from the Latin <em>anima</em>, meaning "breath" or "soul." So, for exmaple, an <em>animal</em> is a living, breathing thing--though human animals have often argued about whether other species actually have souls.</p>
<p><strong>FIG</strong> comes from a Latin verb meaning "to shape or mold" and a noun meaning "a form or shape." So a <em>figure</em> is usually a shape. A <em>transfiguration</em> transforms the shape or appearance of something. And a <em>disfiguring</em> injury changes the appearance of part of the body for the worse.</p>
<p><strong>ANN/ENN</strong> comes from Latin <em>annus</em>, meaning "year." An <em>annual</em> event occurs yearly. An <em>anniversary</em> is an example of an annual event, although the older you get the more frequent they seem to be.</p>
<p><strong>EV</strong> comes from the Latin <em>aevum</em>, "age" or "lifetime." Though the root occurs in only a few English words, it's related to the Greek <em>aion</em>, "age," from which we get the word <em>eon</em>, meaning "a very long period of time."</p>
<p><strong>CORP</strong> comes from <em>corpus</em>, the Latin word for "body." A <em>corpse</em> is a dead body. A <em>corporation</em> is also a kind of body, since it may act almost like an individual. And a <em>corps</em> is a "body" of soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>TANG/TACT</strong> comes from the Latin words <em>tangere</em>, "to touch," and <em>tactus</em>, "sense of touch." So, for instance, to make <em>contact</em> is to touch or "get in touch with."</p>
<p><strong>CODI/CODE</strong> comes from the Latin <em>codex</em>, maning "trunk of a tree" or "document written on wooden tablets." A <em>code</em> can be either a set of laws or a system of symbols used to write messages. To <em>encode</em> a message is to wrtite it in code. A genetic code, transmitted by genes, is a set of instructions for everything from blood type to eye color.</p>
<p><strong>SIGN</strong> comes from the Latin noun <em>signum</em>, "mark or sign." A <em>signal</em> is kind of sign. Your <em>signature</em> is your own personal sign. And an architect's <em>design</em> marks out the pattern for a building.</p>
<p><strong>QUADR/QUART</strong> comes from Latin words meaning "four" or "fourth." In English, a <em>quart</em> is one-fourth of a gallon, just as a <em>quarter</em> is one-fourth of a dollar. A <em>quadrangle</em> has four sides and angles but isn't necessarily square. And <em>quadruplets</em> are four babies born at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>TETR</strong> comes from the Greek word for "four." In the immensely popular video game <em>Tetris</em>, for example, each of the pieces the game is played with has four segments. But the root usually shows up in long chemical names.</p>
