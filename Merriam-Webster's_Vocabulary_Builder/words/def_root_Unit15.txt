<p><strong>TERM/TERMIN</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>terminare</em>, "to limit, bound, or set limits to," and the noun <em>terminus</em>, "limit or boundary." In English, those boundaries or limits tend to be final. A <em>term</em> goes on for a given amount of time and then ends, and to <em>terminate</em> a sentence or a meeting or a ballgame means to end it.</p>
<p><strong>GEO</strong> comes from the Greek word for "Earth." <em>Geography</em> is the science that deals with features of the Earth's surface. <em>Geologists</em> study rocks and soil to learn about the Earth's history and resources. <em>Geometry</em> was originally about measuring portions of the Earth's surface, probably originally in order to determine where the boundaries of Egyptians' farms lay after the annual flooding by the Nile River.</p>
<p><strong>SPHER</strong> comes from the Greek word for "ball." A ball is itself a <em>sphere</em>, as is the ball that we call Earth. So is the <em>atmosphere</em>, and so are several other invisible "spheres" that encircle the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>VERT</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>vertere</em>, meaning "to turn" or "to turn around." <em>Vertigo</em> is the dizziness that makes it seem as if everything is turning around you. And an <em>advertisement</em> turns your attention to a product or service.</p>
<p><strong>MORPH</strong> comes from the Greek word for "shape." <em>Morph</em> is itself an English word with a brand-new meaning, which was needed when we began to digitally alter photographic images or shapes to make them move or transform themselves in often astonishing ways.</p>
<p><strong>FORM</strong> is the Latin root meaning "shape" or "form." When you march in <em>formation</em>, you're moving in ordered patterns. And a <em>formula</em> is a standard form for expressing information, such as a rule written in mathematical symbols, or the "Sincerely yours" that often ends a letter.</p>
<p><strong>DOC/DOCT</strong> comes from the Latin <em>docere</em>, which means "to teach." So, for instance, a <em>doctor</em> was originally a highly educated person capable of instrcuting others in a field--which usually wasn't medicine.</p>
<p><strong>TUT/TUI</strong> comes from a Latin verb meaning "to look after," and in English the root generally shows up in words that include the meaning "guide," "guard," or "teach"--such as <em>tutor</em>, the name for a private teacher who guides a student (or <em>tutee</em>) through a subject.</p>
<p><strong>DI/DUP</strong> Greek and Latin prefixes meaning "two," shows up in both technical and nontechnical terms, wich <em>dup-</em> sometimes shortened to <em>du-</em>. So a <em>duel</em> is a battle between two people. A <em>duet</em> is music for a <en>duo</en>, or pair of musicians. A <em>duplicate</em> is an exact copy, or twin. And if you have <em>dual</em> citizenship, you belong to two countries at once.</p>
<p><strong>BI/BIN</strong> also means "two" or "double." A <em>bicycle</em> has two wheels, and <em>binoculars</em> consist of two little telescopes. <em>Bigamy</em> is marriage to two people at once. And a road built through the middle of a neighborhood <em>bisects</em> it into two pieces.</p>
