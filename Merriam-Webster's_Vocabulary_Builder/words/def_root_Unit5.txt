<p><strong>MAL</strong> comes from a Latin word meaning "bad." A <em>malady</em> is a bad condition--a disease or illness--of the body or mind. <em>Malpractice</em> is bad medical practice. <em>Malodorous</em> things smell bad. And a <em>malefactor</em> is someone guilty of bad deeds.</p>
<p><strong>CATA</strong> comes from the Greek <em>kata</em>, one of whose meanings was "down." A <em>catalogue</em> is a list of items puts down on paper, and a <em>catapult</em> is a weapon for hurling missiles down on one's enemies.</p>
<p><strong>PROT/PROTO</strong> comes from Greek and has the basic meaning "first in time" or "first formed." <em>Protozoa</em> are one-celled animals, such as amoebas and paramecia, that are among the most basic members of the biological kingdom. A <em>proton</em> is an elementary particle that, along with neutrons, can be found in all atomic nuclei. A <em>protoplanet</em> is a whirling mass of gas and dust that astronomers believe may someday become a planet.</p>
<p><strong>ANTE</strong> is Latin for "before" or "in front of." <em>Antediluvian</em>, which describes something very old or outdated, literally means "before the flood"--that is, Noah's Flood. And <em>antebellum</em> literally means "before the war," usually the American Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>ORTHO</strong> comes from <em>orthos</em>, the Greek word for "straight," "right," or "true." <em>Orthotics</em> is a branch of therapy that straightens out your stance or posture by providing artificial support for weak joints or muscles. And <em>orthograde</em> animals, such as human beings, walk with their bodies in a "straight" or vertical position.</p>
<p><strong>RECT</strong> comes from the Latin word <em>rectus</em>, which means "straight" or "right." To <em>correct</em> something is to make it right. A <em>rectangle</em> is a four-sided figure with straight parallel sides. <em>Rectus</em>, short for Latin <em>rectus musculus</em>, may refer to any of several straight muscles, such as those of the abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>EU</strong> comes from the Greek word for "well"; in English words it can also mean "good" or "true." A veterinarian who performs <em>euthanasia</em> is providing a very sick or hopelessly injured animal a "good" or easy death.</p>
<p><strong>DYS</strong> comes from Greek, where it means "bad" or "difficult." So <em>dysphagia</em> is difficult swallowing, and <em>dyspnea</em> is difficult or labored breathing. <em>Dysphasia</em> is an inability to use and understand language because of injury to or disease of the brain. <em>Dys-</em> is sometimes close in meaning to <em>dis</em> (see DIS), but try not to confuse the two.</p>
