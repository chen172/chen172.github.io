<p><strong>BENE</strong> is Latin for "well." A <em>benefit</em> is a good result or effect. Something <em>beneficial</em> produces good results or effects. The Latin root can be heard in other languages as well: "Good!" or "Fine!" in Spanish is "Bueno!"; in French, it's "Bon!"; and in Italian, just say "Bene!"</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong> comes from the Latin <em>amare</em>, "to love." The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and <em>Amor</em>. <em>Amiable</em> means "friendly or good-natured," and <em>amigo</em> is Spanish for "friend."</p>
<p><strong>BELL</strong> comes from the Latin word meaning "war." <em>Bellona</em> was the little-known Roman goddess of war; her husband, Mars, was the god of war.</p>
<p><strong>PAC</strong> is related to the Latin words for "agree" and "peace." The <em>Pacific Ocean</em>--that is, the "Peaceful Ocean"--was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so clam after he had sailed through the storms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never witnessed a Pacific typhoon.)</p>
<p><strong>CRIM</strong> comes from the Latin words for "fault or crime" or "accusation." It's obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A <em>crime</em> is an act forbidden by the government, which the government itself will punish you for, and for which you may be branded a <em>criminal</em>. A crime is usually more serious than a <em>tort</em> (see TORT), a "civil wrong" for which the wronged person must himself sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.</p>
<p><strong>PROB</strong> comes from the Latin words for "prove or proof" and "honesty or integrity." A <em>probe</em>, whether it's a little object for testing electrical circuits or a spacecraft headed for Mars, is basically something that's looking for evidence or proof. And <em>probable</em> originally described something that wasn't certain but might be "provable."</p>
<p><strong>GRAV</strong> comes from the Latin word meaning "heavy, weighty, serious." <em>Gravity</em> is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth at all. This doesn't stop us from yelling in outrage when the familiar laws of gravity cause something to drop to the floor and break.</p>
<p><strong>LEV</strong> comes from the Latin adjective <em>levis</em>, meaning "light," and the verb <em>leave</em>, meaning "to raise or lighten." So a <em>lever</em> is a bar used to lift something, by means of <em>leverage</em>. And <em>levitation</em> is the magician's trick in which a body seems to rise into the air by itself.</p>
