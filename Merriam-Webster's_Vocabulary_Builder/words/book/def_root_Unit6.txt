<p><strong>EQU</strong> comes from the Latin word <em>aequus</em>, meaning "equal." To <em>equalize</em> means to make things equal. Things that are <em>equivalent</em> have the same value, use, or meaning. All three sides of an <em>equilateral</em> triangle are of the same length. And an <em>equation</em> (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two mathematical expressions are equal.</p>
<p><strong>QUIS</strong> is derived from the Latin verb meaning "to seek or obtain." The roots <em>quer, quir</em>, and <em>ques</em> are derived from the same Latin verb and give us words such as <em>inquiry</em> and <em>question</em>.</p>
<p><strong>PLE/PLEN</strong> comes from a Latin word meaning "to fill." It can be seen in the words <em>plenty</em>, meaning basically "filled," and <em>complete</em>, meaning "thoroughly filled."</p>
<p><strong>METR/METER</strong> comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages it refers to "measure." A <em>thermometer</em> measures heat; a <em>perimeter</em> is the measure around something; and things that are <em>isometric</em> are equal in measure.</p>
<p><strong>AUD</strong> from the Latin verb <em>audire</em>, is the root that has to do with hearing. What is <em>audible</em> can be heard. An <em>audience</em> is a group of listeners, sometimes seated in an <em>auditorium</em>. And <em>audio</em> today can be mean almost anything that has to do with sound.</p>
<p><strong>SON</strong> is the Latin root meaning "sound." <em>Sonata</em>, meaning a piece for one or two instruments, was originally an Italian verb meaning "sounded" (when singers were involved, the Italians used a differnent verb). And <em>sonorous</em> means full, load, or rich in sound.</p>
<p><strong>ERR</strong> from the Latin verb <em>errare</em>, means "to wander" or "to stray." The root is seen in the word <em>error</em>, meaning a wandering or straying from what is correct or true. <em>Erratum</em> (plural, <em>errata</em>) is Latin for mistake; so an errata page is a book page that lists mistakes found too late to correct before the book's publication.</p>
<p><strong>CED</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>cedere</em>, meaning "to proceed" or "to yield." <em>Proceed</em> itself employs the root, as does <em>recede</em>, and their related nouns <em>procession</em> and <em>recession</em> employ another form of the Latin verb.</p>
