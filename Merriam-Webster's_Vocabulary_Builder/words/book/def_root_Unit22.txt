<p><strong>ACER/ACR</strong> meaing "sharp" or "sour." Grapefruit and limes have an <em>acid</em> taste; <em>acid</em> can also describle a person's sense of humor (other words for it might be <em>sharp</em> or biting). The <em>acidity</em> of the soil often indicates whether it's good for growing certain crops.</p>
<p><strong>STRICT</strong> meaing "to draw tight, bind, or tie." So the English word <em>strict</em> means "tightly controlled." And when someone begin a sentence "Strictly speaking,..." you know he or she is going to be talking about a word or idea in its most limited sense, "drawing tight" the meaning till it's as narrow as possible.</p>
<p><strong>STRU/STRUCT</strong> meaning "to put together, build, arrange." A <em>structure</em> is something that's been <em>constructed</em>,--that is, built or  put together. <em>Instructions</em> tells how the pieces should be arranged. Something that <em>obstructs</em> is a barrier that's been "built" to stand in your way. And something <em>destructive</em> "unbuilds."</p>
<p><strong>PROP/PROPRI</strong> meaning "own." A <em>proprietor</em> is an owner, and <em>property</em> is what he or she owns.</p>
<p><strong>TORT</strong> meaning "to twist, wind, or wrench." In <em>torture</em>, parts of the body may be wrenched or twisted or stretched; so those "Indian sunburns" that schoolkids give by twisting in different directions on some unlucky guy's wrist stay pretty close to <em>torture</em>'s original meaning.</p>
<p><strong>VIV</strong> meaning "to live or be alive." A <em>survivor</em> has lived through something terrible. A <em>revival</em> brings something back to life, whether it's an old film, interest in a long-dead novelist, or religious enthusiam in a group, may be in a huge tent in the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>SERV</strong> means "to be subject to." A <em>servant</em> is the person who <em>serves</em> you with meals and provides other necessary services.</p>
<p><strong>CLUS</strong> meaning "to close." Words based on the Latin verb often have forms in which the <em>d</em> becomes an <em>s</em>. So, for example, <em>include</em>, which once meant "to shut up or enclose" and now means "to contain," has the releated word <em>inclusive</em>, which means "including everything."</p>
