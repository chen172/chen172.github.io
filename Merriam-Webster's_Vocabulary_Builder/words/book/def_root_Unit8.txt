<p><strong>PORT</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>portare</em>, meaning "to carry." Thus, something <em>portable</em> can be carried around. A <em>porter</em> carriers your luggage, whether through a train station or high into the Himalayas. When we <em>transport</em> something, we have it carried from one place to another. And goods for <em>export</em> are carried away to another country.</p>
<p><strong>PEND</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>pendere</em>, meaning "to hang" or "to weigh." (In the Roman era, weighing something large often required hanging it from a hook on one side of the balance scales.) We find the root in English words like <em>appendix</em>, referring to that useless and sometimes troublesome tube that hangs from the intestine, or that section at the back of some books that might contain some useful additional information.</p>
<p><strong>PAN</strong> comes from a Greek word meaning "all"; as an English prefix, it can also mean "completely," "whole," or "general." A <em>panoramic</em> view is a complete view in every direction. A <em>pantheon</em> is a temple dedicated to all the gods of a religion. A <em>pandemic</em> outbreak of a disease may not affect the entire human population, but enough to produce a catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>EXTRA</strong> is Latin for "outside" or "beyond." So anything <em>extraterrestrial</em> or <em>extragalactic</em> takes place beyond the earth or the galaxy. Something <em>extravagant</em>, such as an <em>extravaganza</em>, goes way beyond the normal. And <em>extra</em> is naturally a word itself, a shortening of <em>extraordinary</em>, "beyond the ordinary."</p>
<p><strong>PHOT</strong> comes from the Greek word for "light." <em>Photography</em> uses light to create an image  on film or paper, and a <em>photocopy</em> is an image made by using light and tiny electrically charged ink particles.</p>
<p><strong>LUC</strong> comes from the Lation noun <em>lux</em>, "light," and the verb <em>lucere</em>, "to shine or glitter." In ancient Rome, <em>Lucifer</em>, meaning  "Light-bearer," was the name given to the morning star, but the name was eventually transferred by Christians to Satan. This tradition, which dates back to the period before Christ, said that Lucifer had once been among the angels but had wanted to be the great light in the sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and thus became the opponent of everything good.</p>
<p><strong>MOR/MORT</strong> comes from Latin words meaning "to die" and "death." A <em>mortuary</em> is a place where dead bodies are kept until burial, and a <em>postmortem</em> examination is one conducted on a recently dead body. The Latin phrase "Memento mori" means "Remember that you must die"; so a <em>memento mori</em> is the name we give to a reminder of death; the skulls you can find carved on gravestones in old cemeteries are examples.</p>
<p><strong>TROPH</strong> comes from the Greek <em>trophe</em>, meaning "nourishment." This particular <em>troph-</em> root doesn't show up in many everyday English words (the <em>troph-</em> in words like <em>trophy, apostrophe</em>, and <em>catastrophe</em> has a different meaning), but instead tends to appear in scientific terms.</p>
