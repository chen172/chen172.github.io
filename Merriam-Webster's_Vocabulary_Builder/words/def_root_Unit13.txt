<p><strong>CORD</strong> from the Laitn word for "heart," turns up in several common English words. So does its Greek relative <em>card-</em>, which is familiar to us in words such as <em>cardiac</em>, "relating to the heart."</p>
<p><strong>CULP</strong> comes from the Latin word for "guilt." Its best-known appearance in English is probaly in <em>culprit</em>, meaning someone who is guilty of a crime.</p>
<p><strong>DICT</strong> comes from <em>dicere</em>, the Latin word meaning "to speak." So, a <em>dictionary</em> is a treasury of words for speaking. And a <em>contradiction</em> (with its prefix <em>contra-</em>, "against") speaks against or denies something.</p>
<p><strong>GNI/GNO</strong> comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning "to know," and can be found at the root of <em>know</em> itself. Among other words built from its root, you may <em>recognize</em> ("know again") some and be <em>ignorant</em> of ("not know") others. But only an <em>ignoramus</em> would know absoultely none of them.</p>
<p><strong>GRAPH</strong> comes from the Greek verb <em>graphein</em>, "to write." Thus, a <em>biography</em> is a written account of someone's life (see BIO), a <em>discography</em> is a written list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and a <em>filmography</em> is a list of motion pictures. But lots of uses of <em>-graph</em> and <em>-graphy</em> don't mean literally "writing" (as in <em>autograph</em> or <em> paragraph</em>), but instead something more like "recording," as in <em>photography, seismograph</em>, or <em>graph</em> itself.</p>
<p><strong>ART</strong> comes from the Latin word for "skill." This reminds us that, until a few centuries ago, almost no one made a strong distinction between  skilled craftsmanship and what we would now call "art." And the word <em>art</em> itself could also mean simply "cleverness." The result is that this root appears in some words where we might not expect it.</p>
<p><strong>PORT</strong> comes from <em>fortis</em>, Latin for "strong." The familiar noun <em>fart</em>, meaning a building strengthened against possible attacks, comes directly from it. And our verb <em>comfort</em> actually means "to give strength and hope to."</p>
<p><strong>CIS</strong> comes from the Latin verb meaning "to cut, cut down, or slay." An <em>incisor</em> is one of the big front biting teeth; beavers and woodchucks have especially large ones. A <em>decision</em> "cuts off" previous discussion amd uncertainty.</p>
