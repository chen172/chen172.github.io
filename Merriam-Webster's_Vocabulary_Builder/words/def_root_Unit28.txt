<p><strong>MEDI</strong> comes form the Latin <em>medius</em>, meaning "middle." Our word <em>medium</em> refers to something in a middle position. The <em>medieval</em> period of European history, also known as the Middle Ages, is the period between Greek and Roman antiquity and the "mordern age." But why people around 1620 began to use the term "Middle Ages," because they regarded themselves as mordern, is an interesting question.</p>
<p><strong>OID</strong> comes from the Greek word for "appearance" or "form." Since <em>aster</em> in ancient Greek meant "star," the small bodies oribiting between Mars and Jupiter that looked like stars through primitive telescopes were called <em>asteroids</em>. A <em>factoid</em> is a little bit of information that looks like a fact, whether it is or not. And some people these days will attach <em>-oid</em> to just about anything; you can probably figure out the meaning of <em>nutsoid, nerdoid</em>, and <em>freakazoid</em> without much help.</p>
<p><strong>SCOP</strong> which usually appears in a suffix, comes from the Greek <em>skopein</em>, meaning "to look at." In English we have the simple noun <em>scope</em>, along with some other words it sometimes stands for: <em>telescope, microscope, periscope</em>, and so on. And have you ever used a <em>stereoscope</em>, a device your greate-grandparents probably enjoyed, which lets you look through a viewer at two slightly different photographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy the illusion that you're seeing it in three dimensions?</p>
<p><strong>TRANS</strong> comes from Latin to indicate movement "through, across, or beyond" something. <em>Translation</em> carries a writer's meaning from one language to another. A television signal is sent or <em>transmitted</em> through the air (or a cable) to your set. When making your way through a city on public <em>transportation</em>, you may have to <em>transfer</em> from one bus or subway to another.</p>
<p><strong>PRO</strong> is an important prefix, with a couple of quite different broad meanings. In this section, we'll look at words in which <em>pro-</em> has the basic meaning "for" or "favoring." Everyone knows words like <em>pro-democracy</em> and <em>pro-American</em>, but other <em>pro-</em> words may not be quite so self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>PRO</strong> in its other broad meaning, means "before, in front of." So, for example, to <em>proceed</em> means "to move out in front"; to <em>progress</em> means to "to move forward"; and somebody <em>prominent</em> stands out, as if he or she were actually standing out in front of the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>RE</strong> is a prefix which, like <em>pro-</em> (see PRO), has more than one meaning. In this section, we'll focus on the meaning "again." We use <em>re-</em> words with this meaning every day--<em>redo, recheck, reread, resell, repaint</em>, etc.--and we feel free to make up new ones as needed. But in plenty of other <em>re-</em> words, the meaning isn't so obvious.</p>
<p><strong>RE</strong> in its other main sense, means "back" or "backward." Since doing something again means going back to it, the two senses are actually related; still, the meaning of <em>re-</em> in most words is pretty clearly one or the other. So a <em>rebound</em> comes back at you; to <em>recall</em> means to "call back" a memory; and to <em>react</em> is to "act back" at someone else's action.</p>
<p><strong>DERM</strong> comes from the Greek <em>derma</em>, meaning "skin." For medical advice on a skin problem such as acne, we may go to a <em>dermatologist</em>, or skin specialist. When we get a shot, it's usually with a <em>hypodermic</em>, a needle that goes "under the skin" (see HYP/HYPO). A <em>pachyderm</em> is a "thick-skinned" animal, which most of us just call an elephant.</p>
<p><strong>ENDO</strong> comes from the Greek  <em>endon</em>, meaning "within." In English it appears almost always in scientific terms, especially in biology. A nonscientific <em>endo-</em> word is <em>endogamy</em>, meaning marriage within a specific group as required by custom or law--one of the many customs that can be seen everywhere from the most remote tribes to the highest society in wealthy countries.</p>
