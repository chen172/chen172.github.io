<p><strong>CAPIT</strong> from the Latin word for "head," <em>caput</em>, turns up in some important places. The head of a ship is its <em>captain</em>, and the <em>capital</em> of a state or country is where the "head of state" works. A <em>capital</em> letter stands head and shoulders above a lowercase letter, as well as at the head (beginning) of a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>ANTHROP</strong> comes from the Greek word for "human being." So an <em>anthropomorphic</em> god, such as Zeus or Athena, basically looks and acts like a human. And in Aesop's fables and many animated cartoons, animals are usually <e>anthropomorphized</e> and behave exactly like furry, four-legged human being.</p>
<p><strong>KINE</strong> comes from the Greek word <em>kinesis</em>, meaning "movement." Kinetic energy of motion (as opposed to potential energy, the kind of energy held by a stretched elastic band). Kinetic art is art that has moving parts, such as Alexander Calder's famous mobiles. And <em>cinema</em>, the art of moving pictures, actually comes from the same <em>kine-</em> root as well.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAM</strong> comes from the Greek <em>dynamis</em>, meaning "power." A <em>dyne</em> is a unit used in measuring force; an instrument that measures force is called a <em>dynamometer</em>. And when Alfred Nobel invented a powerful explosive in 1867, he named it <em>dynamite</em>.</p>
<p><strong>GRAD</strong> comes from the Latin noun <em>gradus</em>, "step" or "degree," and the verb <em>gradi</em>, "to step, walk." A <em>grade</em> is a step up or down on a scale of some kind, and a <em>gradual</em> change takes place in small steps.</p>
<p><strong>REG</strong> from the Latin <em>regula</em>, meaning "rule," has given us many English words. Something <em>regular</em> follows a rule of some kind, even if it's just a law of nature. A <em>regime</em> can be a form of rule or government. To <em>regulate</em> an industry means to make and enforce rules, or <em>regulations</em>, for it; removing such rules is called <em>deregulation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CRIT</strong> comes from a Greek verb that means "to judge" or "to decide." So a film <em>critic</em> judges a movie and tells us what's good or bad about it. Her <em>critical</em> opinion may convince us not to go, or we may overlook any negative <em>criticism</em> and see it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>JUR</strong> comes from the Latin verb <em>jurare</em>, "to swear, take an oath," and the noun <em>jus</em>, "right or law." A <em>jury</em>, made up of <em>jurors</em>, makes judgments based on the law. And a personal <em>injury</em> was originally something done to you that a court would find unjust.</p>
<p><strong>PENT</strong> comes from the Greek word for "five." The <em>Pentagon</em> in Washington, D.C., the world's largest office building, has five sides just like any other pentagon. And a <em>pentatonic</em> scale in music has only five notes, rather than the seven notes of the major or minor scale.</p>
<p><strong>QUINT</strong> comes from the Latin word meaning "five." <em>Quintuplets</em> are babies that come in sets of five; about 60 U.S. families increase in size by that number every year.</p>
