* (1) Over time, the weekly book club meetings *devolve* into mean-spirited gossip sessions.
* (2) Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the British goverment in London to the new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

## Usage
(1) *devolve* and *devolution* are treated nowadays as the opposites of *evolve* and *evolution*. So we may also speak of moral devolution, such as occurred in Germany in the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture became a brutal dictatorship. And parents may watch their slacker teenager and wonder if devolution is occurring right in front of their eyes.  
(2) With its *de-* prefix, *devolution* implies moving backward. Once powers have been centralized in a unified government, giving any powers back--that is, devolving the power--to a smaller governmental unit can seem to be reversing a natural development. In a somewhat similar way, a job that your boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you.
## Synonyms
