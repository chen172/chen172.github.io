# Understanding the Root of "capitalism"
The word "capitalism" comes from the root word *capital*, which ultimately traces back to Latin. Here's a breakdown of its roots:

1. **Capital**:

   * Derived from the Latin *capitale*, which means "money" or "wealth," specifically wealth in the form of property or resources.
   * *Capitale* is rooted in the Latin *caput*, meaning "head" or "top," symbolizing the head or the principal part of something, which in this case referred to the principal wealth or assets used for investment and production.

2. **-ism**:

   * A suffix used in English to form nouns that refer to systems, ideologies, or movements.
   * It comes from the Greek suffix *-ισμος* (*-ismos*), often used to form terms that describe a practice, system, or belief.

Thus, **capitalism** is essentially the system or ideology built around the accumulation and use of *capital* (wealth/resources) to drive economic production and growth.

# Understanding the Root of "anthropoid"
The word **"anthropoid"** is derived from two main roots:

1. **Anthrop-**: From the Greek word "anthrōpos," meaning "human" or "man." It refers to human beings or characteristics related to humans.

2. **-oid**: A suffix of Greek origin ("-oeidēs") meaning "like" or "resembling." It indicates similarity or likeness to something.

So, "anthropoid" literally means "resembling humans" or "human-like," and it’s often used to describe creatures, such as certain primates (e.g., apes), that have human-like characteristics.

# Understanding the Root of "misanthropic"

1. **"Miso-"**: From the Greek *misos*, meaning **"hatred"** or **"dislike"**.
2. **"Anthrop-"**: From the Greek *anthropos*, meaning **"human"** or **"humanity"**.
3. **"-ic"**: A common adjective-forming suffix in English, derived from Greek **"-ikos"**. It typically means **"pertaining to," "of the nature of,"** or **"having the characteristics of."** It turns a noun into an adjective, signifying that something is related to or has the qualities of what the root noun describes.

So, in *misanthropic*, **"-ic"** indicates that the word describes something that pertains to, or is characteristic of, a **misanthrope** (someone who dislikes or hates humanity).

# Understanding the Root of "lycanthropy"
The word **"lycanthropy"** comes from a combination of roots that derive from both Greek and Latin. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Lycan-**: This comes from the Greek root *lykos* (λύκος), which means "wolf."
2. **Anthrop-**: This is derived from the Greek word *anthropos* (ἄνθρωπος), meaning "human" or "man."
3. **-y**: This is a suffix used in English to form nouns that describe a state or condition, often implying a quality or characteristic (in this case, the condition of being a lycanthrope, or werewolf).

So, **lycanthropy** literally means "the condition of being a wolf-man" or "wolf-human," often used to describe the mythical or fictional transformation of a human into a wolf.
