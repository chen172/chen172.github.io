# capitalism

The word **"capitalism"** comes from the root word *capital*, which ultimately traces back to Latin. Here's a breakdown of its roots:

1. **Capital**:

   * Derived from the Latin *capitale*, which means "money" or "wealth," specifically wealth in the form of property or resources.
   * *Capitale* is rooted in the Latin *caput*, meaning "head" or "top," symbolizing the head or the principal part of something, which in this case referred to the principal wealth or assets used for investment and production.

2. **-ism**:

   * A suffix used in English to form nouns that refer to systems, ideologies, or movements.
   * It comes from the Greek suffix *-ισμος* (*-ismos*), often used to form terms that describe a practice, system, or belief.

Thus, **capitalism** is essentially the system or ideology built around the accumulation and use of *capital* (wealth/resources) to drive economic production and growth.

# capitulate

The word **"capitulate"** is derived from the following roots:

1. **Capit-**: From the Latin *capitulum*, meaning "a small head," which is a diminutive form of *caput*, meaning "head."
2. **-ulate**: A suffix used to form verbs that indicate an action or process.

The term *capitulate* originally referred to "giving up or surrendering under agreed terms," often implying the act of negotiating or setting conditions for surrender, much like discussing the terms (or "heads") of an agreement. So, *capitulate* means to "surrender under conditions," often after negotiations.

Thus, **recapitulate** means to "go over the main points again," or "to summarize," often by returning to the "head" or key points of a discussion. The word originally implied "to go over the heads of the chapters" or sections, summarizing the main points.

# anthropoid

2. **-oid**: A suffix of Greek origin ("-oeidēs") meaning "like" or "resembling." It indicates similarity or likeness to something.

So, **"anthropoid"** literally means "resembling humans" or "human-like," and it’s often used to describe creatures, such as certain primates (e.g., apes), that have human-like characteristics.

# anthropology

1. **Anthrop-**: From the Greek *anthrōpos*, meaning "human" or "man."

# misanthropic

1. **"Miso-"**: From the Greek *misos*, meaning **"hatred"** or **"dislike"**.
2. **"Anthrop-"**: From the Greek *anthropos*, meaning **"human"** or **"humanity"**.
3. **"-ic"**: A common adjective-forming suffix in English, derived from Greek **"-ikos"**. It typically means **"pertaining to," "of the nature of,"** or **"having the characteristics of."** It turns a noun into an adjective, signifying that something is related to or has the qualities of what the root noun describes.

So, in *misanthropic*, **"-ic"** indicates that the word describes something that pertains to, or is characteristic of, a **misanthrope** (someone who dislikes or hates humanity).

# lycanthropy

The word **"lycanthropy"** comes from a combination of roots that derive from both Greek and Latin. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Lycan-**: This comes from the Greek root *lykos* (λύκος), which means "wolf."
2. **Anthrop-**: This is derived from the Greek word *anthropos* (ἄνθρωπος), meaning "human" or "man."
3. **-y**: This is a suffix used in English to form nouns that describe a state or condition, often implying a quality or characteristic (in this case, the condition of being a lycanthrope, or werewolf).

So, **lycanthropy** literally means "the condition of being a wolf-man" or "wolf-human," often used to describe the mythical or fictional transformation of a human into a wolf.
